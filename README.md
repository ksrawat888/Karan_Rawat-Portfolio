# Karan Singh Rawat- Data Anlytics Portfolio
**INTRODUCTION**
Hi, I'm Karan! I'm a passionate data analyst with a keen interest in uncovering insight and deriving meaningful conclusions from different types of data. In this repository, I have curated a collection of my data analysis projects that showcase my proficiency in various tools and techniques, and a commitment to delivering actionable insights. I believe that data has stories to tell, and through efficient analysis, visualization, and interpretation, these stories can drive informed decision-making and foster innovation.

I currently pursuing a graduate degree in Management Information Systems (MSIS). I have developed an interest in the field of Data Analytics through my courses after learning of machine learning models and preditice analysis. I have a curiosity to explore datasets and extract valuable insights through data cleaning, data analysis and data visualization. I am excited to apply my technical and analytical skills to widen my horizons and dive deep in the world of Data Analytics. 

**PROJECTS**
1) Spotify Music Analytics 2023: [Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023](https://github.com/ksrawat888/Karan_Rawat-Portfolio/blob/88e904a23da7bdb72aed5963355f232bd8963222/Spotify%202023-%20Data%20Visualizations.ipynb)

In this project, I analyzed a dataset of the most famous songs of 2023 as listed on Spotify using Python. Dataset was retrieved from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023

*GOALS:*
1) Which artistâ€™s songs had the overall most streams (Top 10)?
2) Does the number of featured artists in a song relate to its success on streaming numbers?
3) Is there a correlation between the number of charts/playlists a song is added to and its streams?

*Technology Used*: Python Module: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Wordcloud
